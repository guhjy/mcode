Title: Functions to Merge and Recode Across Multiple Variables
Authors@R: c(person("Thomas J.", "Leeper", role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Functions to create multiple vectors from a single input vector
    (e.g., a matrix of indicator/dummy variables), convert a list, data.frame, or
    matrix of vectors into a single vector (e.g., to merge multiple vectors with
    mutually exclusive missingness into one), and generate new variables based on
    levels and combinations of multiple input vectors (e.g., to create a vector for
    a set of complex recodings).
